## Abstract

Lens Protocol has been in Beta for almost two years now. It’s been quite a long time since the idea of on-chain social emerged with the Lens Open Letter. The protocol has come a long way since then by increasing the amount of clients, scalability, and apps on Lens. With all this said, it’s time for Lens to open the protocol to the community, so it can progress to decentralization. 

## Motivation

Earlier today, a conversation on Farcaster made strides on Lens, which commented on how Farcaster is getting an upper edge on Lens purely because it's permissionless. Since Lens has made tremendous progress on the technical side of protocol (Momoka, Lens V2, ext) it’s time for a staged opening of Lens in order to be decentralized and permissionless. 

## Specification and Rationale

While it is time for Lens to open, it should be in a healthy progression towards decentralization. Lens should look to do this by capping the amount of profiles in the protocol, until vectors for centralization like the API and upgradability are well distributed. It would make sense for Lens to both take users off the waitlist, and invite desirable community members to Lens as it decentralizes. For example, if Lens started its initial opening by whitelisting 50,000 waitlisted and 50,000 Farcaster users, it would be able to inject a large amount of community members that care about on-chain social. Additionally, every month the garden can vote on what community gets invited next until there is sufficient decentralization. In consideration of posting fees, it would make sense for invites to have a free profile + handle as they currently have been, while the whitelists should have a free profile, but the price of the handle should be the approximation of posts for two handles before they are tagged by the subsidizer as spam. Furthermore, it would behoove Lens to also continue a small portion of the cap to invites, so people who are really anxious to join the garden can bring their excitement to Lens.
