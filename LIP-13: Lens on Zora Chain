Abstract

As Lens begins to open up it is important to spread the onchain identity of the platform. After much contemplation, & consternation, I have concluded that Lens should deploy on Zora Chain. 

Motivation

Lens is the home of the creators, and that is no secret. The Developers have come to build a platform, that is without question, the best place for creators. How does Lens grow even after LIP-5? Going to where the creators are so Zora’s Creators can plug directly into the Lens Platform and increase the surface area of their already growing markets. 

Specification

This proposal would lead to the deployment of Lens to Zora Chain. 

1. Zora Ecosystem

Zora is a Stage 0 Optimistic Rollup which uses Optimism’s OP Stack. It has a rolling 30 Day txn count of 1.90 M with an average TPS of 1.12. The Total Value Locked is 14.38 Million. Ether (~ 4,900 ETH near ATH) is the only asset on Zora chain and the only asset for Collecting NFTs. 

2. Lens x Zora

Zora is by nature a place for creators to leverage visual media, from videos to photos, to art. The ability to natively mint on Zora from Lens & vice versa would increase the eyes for both protocols. 

3. Costs

Zora is very cheap currently but we mustn’t forget the EIP-4844 is looking to reduce fees on Layer 2’s very soon. 

4. Momoka

If at all possible, and if needed, a momoka like solution could be deployed to Zora in the future as well. 

Conclusion

If you vote yes on this proposal, Lens Protocol will deploy natively to Zora Chain. If no, Lens will not deploy onto Zora Chain
